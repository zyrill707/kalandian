    <p>Hi love, I'm so happy that I met you. If you only knew how much I love you, you're the only girl that I've treated this way. I hope, my love, you'll never change because I will change. I'll love you unconditionally, and it will improve as the days go by. I don't regret any decisions I've made. I'm so lucky that you are mine. I'll take care of you as long as you love me, my love. I'm ready to give up everything just for you. I can't explain how much I love you because there is no scale or meter that can measure my love for you; it's beyond infinity. You are my very best thing. I can't wait to tell our children how incredible their mom was. I'm so proud of having you; I'm not afraid to show you off. I'm just so proud that you are my wife. I don't regret that. Mahal kita forever.</p>
